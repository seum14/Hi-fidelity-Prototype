## Introduction

Modern Sketching Tools is a physical shop that wanted a website to provide information about their products, shop floor plan, business hours, and contact details. The main purpose of the website is informational, not for online sales. Based on user feedback on the existing lo-fi prototype, we developed a hi-fidelity prototype incorporating suggested improvements. This project includes the updated prototype, a full website walkthrough, features, user acceptance test, and recommendations.

## Website Content

### Home Page

- **Header**: Includes logo, navigation menu, and dark mode toggle.
- **Welcome Section**: Contains a welcome message and social media links.
- **Floor Plan**: Interactive floor plan to navigate product sections.
- **Featured Products**: Highlighted items with hover effects for category display.
- **Products Section**: Lists products with an option to view more.
- **Management Speeches**: Rotating quotes from shop managers.
- **New Arrivals**: Section for new and upcoming products with interactive hover effects.
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Option for customers to subscribe for updates.
- **Footer**: Shop address, contact details, opening hours, product categories, social media links, and copyright information.

### All Category Page

Displays all product categories (Fountain Pen, Marker, Watercolor) with names, prices, and availability. Interactive elements show detailed product descriptions on hover.

### Product Pages

Separate pages for each product category (Fountain Pen, Marker, Watercolor) listing all items with prices, availability, and descriptions.

### Opening Hours Page

Lists the shopâ€™s business hours, including closed days, in a tabular format.

## User Acceptance Test

A user acceptance test was conducted with 5 users to evaluate the website's usability. Users performed specific tasks, and their interactions were recorded to identify errors and measure task completion times.

### Test Users

1. Jimme Kang - BIT in Software Development
2. Prasanna Shresta - BIT in Business Analytics
3. Akmam Hasan - BSC in Computer Science and Engineering
4. Obantika Roy - BSC in Computer Science and Engineering
5. Sadia Sultana Tasnia - BSC in Computer Science and Engineering

### Test Results

- **Tasks**: Navigating from the home page to the All Category page and then to specific product pages.
- **Metrics**: Number of clicks, time taken, and error correction time.
- Detailed results and analysis are provided in the [Results](#results) section.

## Results

The test results are summarized in tables showing the number of clicks and time taken by each user, along with error correction times.

## Features

- **Responsiveness**: The website adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable floor plan, hover effects on products, scroll navigation.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Collapsible menu for better mobile experience.
- **Accessibility**: Ensures usability across different age groups and user experience levels.

## Recommendations

Based on the user acceptance test, we recommend the following improvements:
- **Text Format**: Increase text size, adjust color contrast, and add more spacing between options to reduce navigation errors.
- **Navigation System**: Enhance the navigation to be more intuitive and reduce error correction times.

## Conclusion

The hi-fidelity prototype provides a visually appealing and functional website for Modern Sketching Tools. It meets the informational needs of customers with an easy-to-navigate interface and responsive design. Implementing the recommended improvements will further enhance user experience and usability.
